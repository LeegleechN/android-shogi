			<h3>Server Protocol Ver 1.1</h3>
		</div>
		<h3>1. Background</h3>
		<p>This document specifies the CSA SHOGI protocol for computers to 
play Shogi. </p>
		<h3>2. Overview</h3>
		<p>This protocol assumes there is one server computer acting as the 
judge, and two or more clients acting as shogi players.</p>
		<p>First, the server sends a game condition to two clients which are 
connected; the game will start when, both the clients have agreed to the
 condition.  While playing a game, the player to move sends his move to 
the server and the server measures the time consumed and also determines
 whether the move is legal.</p>
		<h3>3.  Protocol</h3>
		<p>Initially, the server starts the CSA SHOGI service by listening on 
TCP port 4081.  When a client wishes to make use of the service, it 
establishes a TCP connection with the server.  After the connection is 
established, the client and CSA SHOGI server exchange human-readable 
commands and responses (respectively) until the connection is closed or 
aborted.  Commands and responses in the CSA SHOGI must consist of 
case-sensitive ASCII characters in 0x21..0x7f, LF (0x0a) and space 
(0x20).  All messages are terminated by an LF.  TAB must NOT be used.  </p>
		<h3>3.1 Login and Logout</h3>
		<p>Once the TCP connection has been opened by a CSA SHOGI client, the 
client must then identify and authenticate itself to the CSA SHOGI 
server by LOGIN command.  (NOTE: the CSA SHOGI server does NOT issue any
 greeting).  After successful authentication, the session enters a 
GAME-WAITING state.  The client can close the session by LOGOUT command.
  Also, the server may disconnect the session.</p>
		<p>The LOGIN command identifies the client to the server and carries 
the plain-text password authenticating this user.  </p>
		<pre>   Syntax:
   LOGIN &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;

   Responses:
   LOGIN:&lt;username&gt; OK
   -- login completed, now in GAME-WAITING state
   LOGIN:incorrect
   -- login failure: user name or password rejected</pre>
		<p>The &lt;username&gt; consists of digits ('0'-'9'), lowercase or 
uppercase letters ('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z'), underscore ('_'), hyphen ('-'), 
and may be up to 32 characters long.  The &lt;password&gt; may be up to 
32 characters long.  The &lt;password&gt; must not contain any space 
characters.  </p>
		<p>Here is the summary for the LOGOUT command that is only allowed in a
 GAME-WAITING state.  </p>
		<pre>   Syntax:
   LOGOUT

   Responses:
   LOGOUT:completed</pre>
		<h3>3. 2 Game Condition</h3>
		<p>The server may send the GAME CONDITION to a client in a 
GAME-WAITING state, in the following format.  </p>
		<pre>   BEGIN Game_Summary
   Protocol_Version:1.1
   Protocol_Mode:Server
   Format:Shogi 1.0
   Declaration:Jishogi 1.1
   Game_ID:20060505-CSA14-3-5-7
   Name+:TANUKI
   Name-:KITSUNE
   Your_Turn:+
   Rematch_On_Draw:NO
   To_Move:+
   BEGIN Time
   Time_Unit:1sec
   Total_Time:1500
   Least_Time_Per_Move:1
   END Time
   BEGIN Position
   P1-KY-KE-GI-KI-OU-KI-GI-KE-KY
   P2 * -HI * * * * * -KA *
   P3-FU-FU-FU-FU-FU-FU-FU-FU-FU
   P4 * * * * * * * * *
   P5 * * * * * * * * *
   P6 * * * * * * * * *
   P7+FU+FU+FU+FU+FU+FU+FU+FU+FU
   P8 * +KA * * * * * +HI *
   P9+KY+KE+GI+KI+OU+KI+GI+KE+KY
   P+
   P-
   +
   +2726FU,T12
   -3334FU,T6
   END Position
   END Game_Summary</pre>
		<p>A GAME CONDITION is hierarchically structured by BEGIN and END 
pairs. The first line of a GAME CONDITION is 'BEGIN Game_Summary' and 
the last is 'END Game_Summary.'  A game condition consists of three 
blocks; general information (described in 3.2.1), definition of position
 (described in 3.2.2), and definition of time control (described in 
3.2.3).</p>
		<h3>3.2.1 General Information</h3>
		<p>Each line in general information defines the value of a key in the 
format 'key:value.'</p>
		<p>The following fields are mandatory;</p>
		<pre>   Protocol_Version:1.1
   -- (fixed in this protocol)
   Format:Shogi 1.0
   -- (fixed in this protocol)

   Name+:string
   -- name of the first player
   Name-:string
   -- name of the second player

   Your_Turn:[+-]
   -- whether the client receiving the message plays first or second.  
   To_Move:[+-]
   -- player to move in the initial position
      (usually '+' except when resuming an adjourned game)</pre>
		<p>Optional fields:</p>
		<pre>   Protocol_Mode:Server
   -- (fixed in this protocol)

   Declaration:Jishogi 1.1
   -- (fixed at least in the CSA Championship 2006)

   Game_ID:string
   -- string is a game id.

   Rematch_On_Draw:NO
   -- (fixed at least in the CSA Championship 2006)</pre>
		<h3>3.2.2 Definition of Time Control</h3>
		<p>The definition of time control is enclosed by 'BEGIN Time' and 'END
 Time.'  When the definition of time control is omitted, clients are 
allowed to use infinite time.</p>
		<p>One of the following fields is mandatory:</p>
		<pre>   Total_Time:digits
   -- the total time that each player can use in the whole game.  
   Byoyomi:digits
   -- the maximum time that each player can use for each move.  </pre>
		<p>Optional fields:</p>
		<pre>   Time_Unit:digits(min|sec|msec)
   -- default value:1sec
   -- semantics:specifies unit of digits used in other fields.  

   Least_Time_Per_Move:digits
   -- default value:0
   -- semantics: if non-zero, the value is recorded as the consumed time of a player when the player played a move in a shorter time than the value.  

   Time_Roundup:(YES|NO)
   -- default value:NO
   -- semantics: whether time less than one time unit will be rounded up.  </pre>
		<p>3.2.3 Definition of Position</p>
		<p>The definition of the initial position is enclosed by 'BEGIN 
Position' and 'END Position', and is written in the CSA file format.  
This definition may contain moves in addition to position, and in such 
cases, the game starts with a position after all the moves applied.  </p>
		<p>Property 'N+' and 'N-' must not be used, with 'Name+' and 'Name+' 
fields in general information being used instead.  Moreover, 'AL' must 
not be used for the representation of captured pieces.  </p>
		<h3>3.3 AGREEMENT</h3>
		<p>When a client receives a GAME CONDITION, the client must send AGREE
 or REJECT to the server.  </p>
		<pre>   AGREE &lt;gameid&gt;
   -- gameid may be omitted
   REJECT &lt;gameid&gt;
   -- gameid may be omitted</pre>
		<p>When the server receives AGREE from both the clients, the server 
sends a start message in the following format.</p>
		<pre>   START:&lt;gameid&gt;</pre>
		<p>Then both the clients enter a GAME state.  </p>
		<p>Otherwise, if any client has rejected the game, the server sends a 
REJECT message in the following format to both the clients.</p>
		<pre>   REJECT:&lt;gameid&gt; by &lt;rejector&gt;</pre>
		<p>Then both the clients enter a GAME-WAITING state.  </p>
		<h3>3.4 Move Commands</h3>
		<p>Clients must use any of the following commands in a GAME state, 
which is a subset of the ones defined in the CSA file format.  </p>
		<pre>- &lt;normal move&gt; (e.g.  , +7776FU)
- %TORYO
- %KACHI</pre>
		<p>For each move sent by a client to move, the server sends a 
MOVE-CONFIRMATION to both clients.  MOVE-CONFIRMATION is a line 
consisting of the move and the consumed time joined by a comma (',').  </p>
		<p>In the case of illegal moves, the move included in 
MOVE-CONFIRMATION must be truncated up to 7 characters long.</p>
		<p>An example of MOVE-CONFIRMATION:</p>
		<pre>- +7776FU,T12
- %TORYO,T4</pre>
		<p>If the server detects a game-end, the server must send a 
GAME-RESULT to both clients.  If the game was ended by a client command,
 a GAME-RESULT must be sent immediately after MOVE-CONFIRMATION.  In the
 case of time-up, the server immediately sends a GAME-RESULT without 
waiting for a message from the client to move.</p>
		<p>GAME-RESULT consists of two lines beginning with the sharp ('#') 
character.  The first line shows the reason and the second line shows 
win or lose from the viewpoint of a client receiving the message.  
Clients enter a GAME-WAITING state after they have received a 
GAME-RESULT.  </p>
		<p>The first line must be one of the following six messages:</p>
		<pre>   #SENNICHITE
   -- (draw by repetition)

   #OUTE_SENNICHITE
   -- (illegal move by repetition)

   #ILLEGAL_MOVE
   -- (other illegal moves including illegal use of %KACHI)

   #TIME_UP

   #RESIGN
   -- (one player resigned by '%TORYO')

   #JISHOGI
   -- (one player declared a win by '%KACHI' and the declaration is legal)</pre>
		<p>The second line must be one of the following three messages:</p>
		<pre>   #DRAW
   -- only after '#SENNICHITE'
   #WIN
   #LOSE</pre>
		<p>For example, if a player has resigned after thinking four time 
units, the player receives the following messages.  </p>
		<pre>   %TORYO,T4
   #RESIGN
   #LOSE</pre>
		<p>The other player also receives the following messages.   </p>
		<pre>   %TORYO,T4
   #RESIGN
   #WIN</pre>
		<h3>3.5 Summary</h3>
		<p>Here is an example of messages in a game.  </p>
		<pre>     client1           server                                     client2

   8                                                           &lt;- [the third move]
   9                &lt;- [MOVE-CONFIRMATION for the third move]  -&gt;
